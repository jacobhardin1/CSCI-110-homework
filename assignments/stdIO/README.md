Program asks for a name, then greets them using said name and prints out 4 cards for them.

Program meets all requirements.

Ran and tested the program several times, using various names, no name, numbers, special characters, escape characters, etc. No bugs found.

Self-evaluated grade: 100%.
Self-eval notes: I'm pretty sure I can make it smaller and/or faster. This program is a proof of concept that I can do it, not that this is the best possible way of doing it. I feel like I could spend more time on it.
Self-eval note 2: Program is easy to read and functions without bugs as far as I can tell.

TO-DO: N/A. Program is complete as is.


Included at the bottom is an additional 2 lines that are commented out, that print out the same ascii characters seen within the variables cardOne, cardTwo, cardThree, and cardFour from a text file rather than from said variables. I have not tested those two lines on a different machine, but they should work.
