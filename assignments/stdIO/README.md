Program asks for a name, then greets them and prints out 4 cards for them. Included at the bottom is an additional 2 lines that are commented out, that print out the same ascii characters seen within the variables cardOne, cardTwo, cardThree, and cardFour from a text file rather than from said variables. I have not tested those two lines on a different machine, but they should work.

Program meets all requirements.

Ran and tested the program several times, using various names, no name, numbers, special characters, escape characters, etc. No bugs found.

Self-evaluated grade: 80%.
Self-eval notes: I'm pretty sure I can make it smaller and/or faster. This program is a proof of concept that I can do it.

TO-DO: N/A. Program is complete as is.
