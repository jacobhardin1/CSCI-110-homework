## Bitwise

## There are several number system bases.
## binary (base 2, 0 and 1)
## Octal (base 8, 0 through 7. Think counting w/ fingers, except thumbs missing)
## Decimal (base 10, 0 through 9. Think counting w/ fingers)
## Hexadecimal (Base 16, 0 through 9 + a through f)
## base 360 (circles! We don't use this except in circle math)

print("This is the hexadecimal form of the decimal number 255: ", hex(255))
print("This is the binary form of the decimal number 255: ", bin(255))
print("This is the binary form of the hex number FD: ", bin(0xFD))
print("This is the dec number of the hex number FD: ", int(0xFD))
## Negative numbers

## Two's complement - invert all bits. Add one.

## bitwise left shift: << - multiply bin number by 2 (imagine multiplying by 10)
## bitwise right shift: >> - divide bin num by 2 (imagine div by 10)
## bitwise AND - &
## bitwise OR - |
## bitwise NOT - ~
## bitwie XOR - ^

## format(value, format_spec) = formats the given value using the format.
